# Week 2 Assignment

## Overview
This assignment concerns media queries as needed for building responsive web pages and the Bootstrap framework. 

As an added twist, I will be working with Bootstrap 4, which is currently in alpha release. So far my testing of this shows that Bootstrap 4 operates about the same as Bootstrap 3. Documentation for Bootstrap 4 suggests that we should employ stlying best practices of normalize.css, such as using em rather than px for size paramters. Bootstrap 4 is actually a smaller package because it drops glyphs/icons included with Bootstrap 3, so these must be included as separate icon/glyph files. Bootstrap 4 also has an extra small setting for responsiveness, making solutions compatible with very small screens. If you interact with the web through your own version of a Dick Tracy watch, whether the product of Apple or Google, you may be better served by Bootstrap 4. 

## Viewing the Websites

The results of this homework are available as GitHub web pages.

## Requirements

The first part of this homework utilized media queries to make a website responsive without the help of Bootstrap. This work is provided under the Responsive-Portfolio repository.

The second part of the assignment used Bootstrap in all its glory. This work is provided under the Bootstrap-Portfolio repository.

Both parts were version-controlled and shared via Git/GitHub, with gh_pages deployment for Bootstrap-Portfolio.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (style.css after Bootstrap 4 css and Yeti Bootswatch)
- JavaScript (via Bootstrap 4)
- Git/GitHub
- Media Queries
- Bootstrap

## Code Explanation
- We start with GitHub, setting up two new repositories: Responsive-Portfolio and Bootstrap-Portfolio
- Clone the portfolios and create base files for html and css work
- Code media queries only for the Responsive-Portfolio repository
- Gather the appropriate css and js files (Because I like to be able to continue working when I do not have a connection to the Internet, I include copies of these files in the repositories.)
- Utilize bootstrap components for the Bootstrap-Portfolio repository using Bootstrap 4 alpha code
- Deploy the Bootstrap-Portfolio to gh_pages
